# Football-League-Simulator-

## This is a simulator run with node.js in the terminal of VisualStudio Code.

Simply run SimuYears(number of years), and the system will predict that many years of football including promotions and relegations.
The program uses team biases based off real life performance to predict the year of football.



## issues:
 * Need to address issue with teams having the same points (goal difference isn't yet considered in sorting.)
